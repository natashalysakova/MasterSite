        <H4 class="referat-title" id="introduction"> Introduction </h4>

        <P>
            The solution of problems of mathematical programming, which can be represented as a multi-stage
            process is the subject of dynamic programming. With this dynamic
            programming are a special mathematical method of optimization solutions specifically adapted to the
            multistep process. A multi-step process is generally considered that develops over time and decompose into
            a series of "steps" or "stages"
        </P>

        <P>
            In this paper we will consider what a classical dynamic programming
            multidimensional problem of dynamic programming and the relatively new method of combining methods
            dynamic programming method of branches and borders.
        </P>
        <H4 class="referat-title" id="targets"> Goals and Objectives </h4>

        <P> The aim of this work is the design and analysis of algorithms multidimensional dynamic programming. To
            achieve this goal it is necessary to solve several problems: </p>

        <Ul class="list">
            <Li> analyze the existing problems;</li>
            <Li> select the most interesting and relevant problems;</li>
            <Li> develop algorithm of dynamic programming;</li>
            <Li> evaluate the results of the following criteria: accuracy, complexity, time, memory.</Li>
        </Ul>
        <P> Each algorithm must be accompanied by a unit of instruction and theoretical reference for the application of
            a method. </p>


        <H4 class="referat-title" id="actuality"> Relevance of the topic </h4>

        <P> The urgency of developing algorithms for solving multidimensional dynamic programming is a HYIP because in
            fact, the whole history of mankind is connected with the solution of optimization problems. These tasks are
            used both in the home and in the workplace. Under normal circumstances, a person can solve the optimization
            problem at manage family budget, and in the production of this problem may be related to optimal
            design of devices, tools, etc. Dynamic programming is fast and accurate way to solve these problems by
            getting rid of repeating calculations. </P>

        <P></p>

        <H4 class="referat-title" id="classification"> Classification of tasks multidimensional dynamic
            programming </h4>

        <P> If the solution of the problem solution uses a single task the previous levels, the formulation of the
            problem DP
            It is a monadic
            Otherwise it is called polyadic. The digraph without loops tops can be divided into levels, so that
            the problem at this level depend only on the previous levels of subtasks. Depending on the communications
            tasks for different levels, formulation of the problem can be attributed DP either serials or to nonserial
            tasks. If the problem of the family at all levels depend only on the results of the tasks are to immediately
            preceding level, such a task would be called DP serial task, otherwise it incoherence task called DP.
            Using these two criteria for the classification problem can be attributed to the
            DP
            one of the following: </p>

            <Li> incoherence-polyadic</li>
        </Ul>


        <H4 class="referat-title" id="distribution"> The problem of resource allocation </h4>

        <P> The most interesting problems of resource allocation. In general terms, this problem can be described as
            follows manner. There are a certain number of resources that can be understood by money, material resources
            (raw materials, semi-finished products, human resources, various types of equipment, etc.). These resources
            should be divided between the different objects of use over separate planning period or intervals between
            objects and various intervals so as to obtain the maximum overall efficiency of return on assets
            (maximization problem), or the total cost, cost, execution time given volume works (minimization problem),
            and others. </p>

        <P> Most of the problems of mathematical programming fits the general problem of optimal Resolution resource
            allocation. But when considering the patterns making such tasks necessary to specify the common the shape of
            the problem of resource allocation. Mathematical model of resource allocation problems depicted in the
            formula 6. </P>
        <Img src="diss/img/2015-05-21_181211.png" class="img-responsive">

        <P> A typical problem of resource allocation has the following wording: </p>

        <P> There are some initial amount of resources ξ_0, to be distributed during the years between the n-
            s-enterprises. Resources u_ki (k = 1,2, ..., n; i = 1, ..., s), isolated in the year k-i-to enterprise
            bring a profit of f_ki (u_ki) and at the end of the year in the number of returning φ_ki (u_ki). The
            following
            distribution of profits can be used, and can not be used. We must find a way
            resource allocation (the amount of resources allocated to each company in each plan year) to
            the total income from the s-enterprises to n-years was the maximum. </p>

        <P> Thus, as an indicator of the efficiency of resource allocation to the n-years received
            the total income derived from s-enterprises (Formula 7). </P>
        <Img src="diss/img/2015-05-21_181211.png" class="img-responsive">

        <P> In formulating the problem of optimal allocation of resources was assumed that the return on every step from
            all
            enterprises and maximum income Z_k * (ξ), starting with the k-th step to the end of the planning period,
            depended only
            the state of the system at the ξ k-th step, and from the management u_k = (u_k1, u_k2 ..., u_ks) n </p>

        <P> Thus, it violated one of the conditions imposed to optimization problems, in order that they can be
            describe a model of dynamic programming. To take into account the background of the process of resource
            allocation,
            You can increase the number of options at each step, to artificially include </p>


        <H4 class="referat-title" id="combination"> The combination of dynamic programming method and branches
            boundaries </h4>

        <P> A large class of applications of optimization comes down to integer programming problems. To
            these tasks are widely used combinatorial methods based on the ordered checking
            the most promising options. Combinatorial methods for the solution can be divided into two groups: methods
            dynamic programming and branch and bound method. </p>

        <P> When solving multi-dimensional optimization problems proposed joint use of the branch-and-bound and
            dynamic programming. At the first stage, the problem is solved by dynamic programming
            separately for each of the restrictions. Sequences obtained from solutions functional
            equation of dynamic programming, is then used to estimate the upper (lower) border
            objective function. In the second stage the problem is solved by the branch and bound. With this method
            determined by way of dividing the entire set of valid options for a subset, then there is a way
            constructing a tree of options, and a method of estimating the upper limit of the target function. </p>

        <P> Complex application of dynamic programming and branch and bound can improve
            the effectiveness of solving discrete optimization problems. When solving large-scale problems with a view
            reducing members optimal sequence use the additional clipping. </p>

        <P> The search algorithm solutions combined branch and bound method shown below: </p>

        <Img src="diss/img/combination.png" class="img-responsive">

        <P> The main directions of complex application of dynamic programming and branch and
            boundaries is: </p>
        <Ul class="list">
            <Li> pruning unpromising options using the principle of optimality and estimation of boundaries by solutions
                removing conditions integer;
            </Li>
            <Li> Use the optimal sequence of dynamic programming;</li>
            <Li> pruning unpromising options using optimality principle and the decision on the assessment boundaries
                optimal sequence.
            </Li>
        </Ul>

        <P> It is expected that the combined application of dynamic programming and branch and bound allow
            improve the efficiency of solving discrete optimization problems, it is the purpose of further
            research. </p>

        <H4 class="referat-title" id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h4>

        <P> Dynamic programming is often used to solve optimization problems, because It allows
            reduce the time and complexity of the solution at times. </p>

        <P> Unfortunately, not always the solution obtained by the method of dynamic programming is
            optimal, and therefore developed alternatives solutions tasks. One such option
            there is a combination of solutions by dynamic programming method of branches and borders. Analysis and
            implementation of this combined method is one of the main tasks of the author in writing within
            thesis. </p>
